# Laptop Price Prediction Webapp

## Goal üéØ

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application tailored for accurately predicting the Market Retail Price (MRP) of laptops based on their attributes using advanced machine learning models.

## Model Used for the Web App üßÆ

The web application utilizes a machine learning model trained for Laptop Price Prediction. The model architecture includes a regression model trained on a dataset of laptops with various attributes.

## Features of the Web App üåê

- **Input Laptop Attributes**: Allows users to input 13 different attributes of a laptop.
- **MRP Prediction**: Provides the predicted MRP based on the input attributes.
- **Detailed Insights**: Offers detailed insights about how different attributes affect the MRP.

**Note:** Ensure to update the paths accordingly based on your local machine's directory structure.


## How to Use

- **Requirements**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. You can find the list of required packages in the requirements.txt file.

- **Download Data**: Download the Laptop Price Prediction Dataset from Kaggle mentioned in the dataset section of the project.

- **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file and run each cell sequentially. Make sure to update any file paths or configurations as needed for your environment.

- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the models using the provided data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).

- **Interpret Results**: Analyze the model's performance using the visualizations and metrics provided in the notebook.
