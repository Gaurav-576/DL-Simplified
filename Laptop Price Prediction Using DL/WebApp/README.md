# Laptop Price Prediction Webapp

## Goal üéØ

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application tailored for accurately predicting the Market Retail Price (MRP) of laptops based on their attributes using advanced machine learning models.

## Model Used for the Web App üßÆ

The web application utilizes a machine learning model trained for Laptop Price Prediction. The model architecture includes a regression model trained on a dataset of laptops with various attributes.

## Features of the Web App üåê

- **Input Laptop Attributes**: Allows users to input 13 different attributes of a laptop.
- **MRP Prediction**: Provides the predicted MRP based on the input attributes.
- **Detailed Insights**: Offers detailed insights about how different attributes affect the MRP.

**Note:** Ensure to update the paths accordingly based on your local machine's directory structure.

5. *Run the Streamlit Application*
   Navigate to the directory containing the Streamlit script (e.g., app.py) and run the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run web.py
   ```

6. *Open the Application*
   After running the above command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) where you can access the application in your web browser.

## Example Commands

1. *Clone the Repository*
   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   

2. *Install Dependencies*
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. *Run the Streamlit Application*
   bash
   streamlit run app.py
   

4. *Open in Browser*
   Access the provided URL in your browser to interact with the Streamlit application.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the Streamlit application locally on your system. Make sure to update any file paths or configurations as needed for your¬†environment.
